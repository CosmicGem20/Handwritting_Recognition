#‚úçÔ∏è Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN
This project demonstrates a deep learning model built with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset.

The model takes grayscale images of handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) as input and predicts the correct digit class. The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 labeled images (28x28 pixels), making it an ideal beginner dataset for computer vision and neural network projects.

#üîç Problem Statement
The goal is to accurately classify handwritten digit images using a CNN model. The network learns features like edges, curves, and shapes to distinguish between digits effectively.

#üöÄ Features
